### PIC32MZ Boilerplate

This repository contains the boilerplate code for a DSP platform I am developing for select PIC32MZ microprocessors

##### Current Features

- *delay.c* Blocking delay routines
- *audio.c* Audio CODEC support through I2S protocol
- *adc.c* Basic on-board ADC routines with software filtering leveraged
- *timers.c* Timer configuration for peripherals and other misc tasks
- *uart.c* Basic UART routines, mainly for debugging
- *dsp.c* DSP structures and routines
